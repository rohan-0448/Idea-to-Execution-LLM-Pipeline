Text: Combining CodeMonkeys with Autonomy of Experts (AoE) for Dynamic Algorithmic Trading Strategy Generation and Execution

This idea leverages the strengths of both CodeMonkeys and Autonomy of Experts (AoE) to create a dynamic and adaptive algorithmic trading system.

CodeMonkeys, with its iterative and parallel approach to strategy generation and testing, forms the core of the strategy development engine. It generates a diverse pool of trading strategies, each with varying asset selections, indicators, and trading logic.

AoE principles are applied to the execution layer. Each trading strategy generated by CodeMonkeys is treated as an "expert." These experts autonomously evaluate their suitability for current market conditions based on their internal activations (e.g., confidence in signals, risk metrics). Only the top-ranking experts, deemed most appropriate by AoE principles, are selected to execute trades.

Key aspects:

Dynamic Expert Selection: AoE continuously monitors the performance and internal state of each expert (strategy). Experts that consistently underperform or exhibit high risk are automatically deactivated or re-evaluated by CodeMonkeys for refinement.

Adaptive Ensemble: The ensemble of active experts is not static. It dynamically adjusts based on market conditions and expert performance. This allows the system to adapt to changing market dynamics and focus on strategies that are currently most effective.

Resource Allocation: AoE can allocate trading capital proportionally to the confidence and performance of each active expert. Strategies with higher confidence and better track records receive a larger share of the capital.

Risk Management: AoE incorporates risk management at both the individual expert level (e.g., stop-loss orders) and the ensemble level (e.g., portfolio diversification).
