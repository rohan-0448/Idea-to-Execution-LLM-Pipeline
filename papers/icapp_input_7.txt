Text: : Adaptive Strategy Ensembles via Autonomy-of-Experts and CodeMonkeys

Idea: Combine the Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE) concept with the CodeMonkeys framework to create a dynamically adapting ensemble of trading strategies. The core idea is to have a diverse set of trading strategies (the 'experts'), each with the ability to self-assess its suitability for the current market conditions (as in AoE). The CodeMonkeys approach is then used to iteratively refine and test these strategies, as well as to explore new strategy variations. A meta-learner uses the output of the AOE and past performance of strategies to optimize the weights of each strategy in the ensemble. The iterative testing of the ensemble would happen via backtesting on historical data. This leverages the strengths of both approaches: AoE provides a mechanism for expert selection based on relevance, while CodeMonkeys enables continuous improvement and exploration of the strategy space. The ensemble weights are then dynamically adjusted to achieve betterÂ profitabilty.
