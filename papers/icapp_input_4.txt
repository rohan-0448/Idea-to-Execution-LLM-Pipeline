Instead of a fixed set of experts (trading strategies), use CodeMonkeys to continuously generate and refine a diverse pool of candidate strategies. AoE would then be used to autonomously select the best-performing strategies based on current market conditions and their self-assessed suitability. This creates a self-evolving, adaptive trading system where new strategies are constantly created and vetted, and only the most relevant ones are deployed at any given time.
