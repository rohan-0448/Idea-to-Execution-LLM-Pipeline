Text: Combining Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE) with CodeMonkeys for adaptive, self-improving algorithmic trading. This involves creating a system where multiple trading strategies (experts) can autonomously evaluate their suitability based on current market conditions, as in AoE, while also iteratively refining their code and parameters through parallel testing and feedback loops, similar to CodeMonkeys. The experts would not only decide whether to execute a trade but also continuously improve their trading logic based on backtesting results, ensemble performance, and market dynamics. A central arbiter, learned via reinforcement learning, chooses which experts to combine. Error accumulation and noise issues would be adressed via noise augmentation as explained in CAMs.
