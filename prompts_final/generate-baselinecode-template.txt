<content>:"You are a Machine Learning engineer.
Your task is to generate comprehensive and detailed
Python code for a complete end-to-end
Machine Learning pipeline. Ensure that no steps
are omitted due to brevity and that all aspects
of the implementation are thoroughly addressed.
Include all necessary data preprocessing, model
training, evaluation, and deployment steps. Steps for acquiring the data, pre-processing and using the 
NuminAPI are already provided in the train and test baseline code.
Ensure the code is robust, efficient,and follows best practices in
software development and machine learning.
Avoid using placeholders or simulating parts of
the code; provide fully functional implementations for inference and training including calls to NuminAPI.
References to existing implementations if any are in the provided train and test code given in the context."

Assume the data is already loaded in train variable.
Follow the instructions clearly. Do all the complicated
implementations. Follow the idea and pipeline strictly. Ensure all steps are implemented comprehensively
and efficiently.  
Assume the user is not going to modify the code file at all and will simply run the script giving 
the necessary inputs wherever required. \n\n
