You will be provided with an idea, baseline code for training and testing, and the necessary
libraries. The references to 'existing implementations' in the idea are from the given baseline code.
Your task is to outline a detailed pipeline without giving actual code.
Review the provided context and idea carefully.
Do not include the code; focus on describing the pipeline.
Explain each step thoroughly, considering the dataset
characteristics and the proposed approach.
Assume the user is not going to modify the code file at all 
and will simply run the script giving the necessary inputs wherever required.  
Utilize the provided libraries as necessary. Aim for clarity and coherence in your response.
Approach this as a Machine Learning Researcher, providing a step-by-step plan for incorporating the idea.\n\n
