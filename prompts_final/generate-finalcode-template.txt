<content>"Your task is to modify the existing
Python code provided in \n\n{baseline_code}\n\naccording
to {idea}, ensuring alignment with
{refined_methodology}. Maintain the current
code structure while adapting it to meet the
requirements of idea. Take necessary API keys as input from the user.
Avoid altering the fundamental code layout. Do not assume additional information about the config.yaml file. Provide full
implementations for inference and training including the NuminAPI calls without assuming any details. Steps for 
acquiring the data, pre-processing and using the NuminAPI are already provided in the train and test baseline code.
MAKE SURE DIFFERENT CODE FILES ARE GENERATED FOR TRAIN AND INFERENCE RESPECTIVELY.
If no additonal libraries are required, write "Additional Libraries: None" at the end of your response.
Ensure to return a non-zero error code in case any errors/exceptions are encountered.
