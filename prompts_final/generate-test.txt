You are a machine learning researcher. Your task is to adapt an existing testing base code to create a new testing code that aligns with the `model`  and `train_code` provided. 
    
Follow these steps:
1. Analyze the methodology described in the `high_level_plan` to understand the core problem and approach.
2. Modify the testing pipeline to ensure compatibility with the `model`, keeping essential components like data loading, preprocessing, loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics aligned with the methodology.
3. Ensure that the testing procedure follows best practices for the specified `model` while preserving any insights from the `high_level_plan`.
4. Do not assume additional information about the config.yaml file.
5. Ensure the code exits with a non-zero error code in case of any errors/exceptions.

Input:
- high_level_plan: ```{high_level_plan}```
- Given Model: ```{model_given}```
- Existing Testing Code: 
```{base_code}```
Output:
- A new baseline testing code adapted for the `model`, ensuring alignment with the described methodology and objectives.
GIVE ONLY THE BASELINE TESTING CODE WITH {model_given} AND WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL TEXT/INFORMATION.
