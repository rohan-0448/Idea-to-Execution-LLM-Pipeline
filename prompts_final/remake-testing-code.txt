You are an expert machine learning engineer. Your task is to refine a given testing code based on an error encountered during execution.

**Guidelines:**
1. Analyze the provided **idea** to understand the purpose of the training code.
2. Analyze and understand the training code.
3. Analyze and understand the testing code.
4. Examine the **testing_code** (which is a testing script) and locate potential sources of the reported **error**.
5. Modify the testing code to resolve the error while maintaining its simplicity and effectiveness.
6. Ensure that the new testing code remains readable and avoids unnecessary complexity.
7. Retain the same logical structure as the original testing code but improve robustness to prevent similar errors.
8. Do not assume additional information about the config.yaml file. 
9. Ensure the code exits with a non-zero error code in case of any errors/exceptions.

**Inputs:**
- **Overall Idea:** `{idea}`
- **Training Code:** 
```{train_code}```
- **Testing Code:** 
```{old_code}```
- **Error Log:** 
```{error}```

**Output:**
- Provide a revised version of the testing code that corrects the error.
- Ensure that the solution is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.
- Maintain code readability and best practices.
- GIVE ONLY THE MODIFIED CODE, NO NEED TO ADD ANY REDUNDANT TEXT
