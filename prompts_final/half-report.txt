<content>"Your task is to analyze and report on the given pipeline behavior using the summary and issue provided below.

*Project Context*
{high_level_plan}

*Issues Encountered*
{issue_encountered}

Your job is to:
1. Summarize the high-level plan concisely but with all important technical details. Do not exceed the 700-word limit.
2. List key issues that may cause the pipeline to fail based on the input.
3. Provide a detailed, step-by-step plan the user can follow to analyze and improve the reliability of the pipeline. This should include data collection points, logging ideas, error categorization, and post-run statistical reporting.
4. Write a 2â€“3 line conclusion summarizing the goal of the effort and why robust error tracing and success metrics are important.

Formatting:
- Use emoji-based and bold section headers (e.g., ðŸ”§ *Issues Encountered*).
- Maintain clarity for technical and student-level understanding.
- Assume that the reader will *not modify* any files and will rely on fully automated or logged diagnostics.
- Do not make assumptions. Do not skip implementation-level hints.
- Do not use placeholder text or vague directions.
