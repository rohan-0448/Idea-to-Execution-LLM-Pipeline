You are a machine learning researcher. Use the following systematic approach and the provided baseline code in order to refine the methodology generated at the end of the text enclosed in the triple backquotes.
1. Check method details. Verify that the generated methodology does not try to compare the performance of the model with other models. 
2. Was idea adapted?
3. Is method appropriate?
4. Write method steps.
5. Write pseudocode. Provide separate base code for the train and test part. Do not provide actual implementation, focus on clearly defining the steps to be followed.
