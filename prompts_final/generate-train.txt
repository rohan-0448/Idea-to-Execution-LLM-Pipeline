You are a machine learning researcher. Your task is to adapt an existing training base code to create a new training code that aligns with the `model` provided. 

Follow these steps:
1. Analyze the methodology described in the `high_level_plan` to understand the core problem and approach.
2. Modify the training pipeline to ensure compatibility with the `model`, keeping essential components like data loading, preprocessing, loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics aligned with the methodology.
3. Ensure that the training procedure follows best practices for the specified `model` while preserving any insights from the `high_level_plan`.
4. Implement comprehensive training metrics tracking:
   - Calculate and log training loss for each batch
   - Calculate and log validation loss and accuracy after each epoch
   - Save the best model based on validation performance
5. Include proper data splitting for validation (e.g., 80-20 or 70-30 split)
6. Add visualization of training progress (e.g., print statements or progress bars)
7. Do not assume additional information about the config.yaml file.
8. Ensure the code exits with a non-zero error code in case of any errors/exceptions.

Input:
- Research Paper high_level_plan: ```{high_level_plan}```
- Given Model: ```{model_given}```
- Existing Training Code: 
```{base_code}```

Output:
- A new baseline training code adapted for the `model`, ensuring alignment with the research paper's methodology and objectives.
- The code should include proper metrics calculation, validation, and model checkpointing.
GIVE ONLY TRAINING CODE WITH {model_given} AND MAKE SURE IT WORKS.
