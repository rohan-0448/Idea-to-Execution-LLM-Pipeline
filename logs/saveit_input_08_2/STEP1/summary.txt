The paper proposes a novel algorithmic trading system that combines Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE) with Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) to dynamically select and execute trading strategies. The system treats different trading strategies as autonomous "experts" that self-evaluate their suitability based on real-time market conditions. MCTD then generates and optimizes trading trajectories for the selected experts, and the best trajectories are combined into an ensemble strategy. This approach aims to improve adaptability, robustness, exploration of opportunities, and risk management. However, the implementation faces challenges including complexity, high computational costs, substantial data requirements, and the risk of overfitting.
