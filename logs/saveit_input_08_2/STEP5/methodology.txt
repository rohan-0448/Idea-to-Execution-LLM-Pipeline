Okay, I will use the system prompt to incorporate the dataset context information into the methodology.

**1. Introduce Method:**

The proposed algorithmic trading system combines Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE) with Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) to dynamically select and execute trading strategies. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional systems by adapting to changing market conditions and diversifying strategy deployment. Different trading strategies are treated as autonomous "experts," evaluating their suitability based on real-time market conditions. MCTD then generates and optimizes trading trajectories for selected experts, and the best trajectories are combined into an ensemble strategy.

**2. Establish Connections:**

The data used to train and test the system will play a crucial role in its performance. The connection between the real-time market conditions that the "experts" analyze and the historical data used to train their "relevance scores" is fundamental. Similarly, the MCTD algorithm's trajectory generation and optimization are directly dependent on the data used to train the underlying diffusion model and the reward function's parameters. Finally, the ensemble execution and weighting mechanism rely on the backtested performance of the trajectories using historical data. A critical aspect is ensuring that the training data accurately reflects the market dynamics the system will encounter in live trading.

**3. Discuss Analysis:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Historical market data is acquired through API calls to the Numin Platform. This data includes price, volume, volatility, and other relevant features required for expert self-assessment and trajectory optimization. Data is downloaded and saved as CSV files (e.g., 'df_val_01-Apr-2024.csv') within the `./training_data` directory. The Numin platform may provide both training and testing datasets, with additional training data available as specified in the `train_baseline` code (not provided, but assumed to exist on the platform).
*   **Data Format:** The data is structured with each row representing a specific time step. The 'id' column, containing stock identifiers in text format, allows tracking the evolution of different stocks or trading instruments. Other columns represent market features as floating-point values.
*   **Target Variable (Training Data):** Training data includes a 'target' variable representing the expected trading outcome. This variable is initially in the range [-1, 1] and is transformed to [0, 4] using the formula:  `y = [int(2 * (score_10 + 1)) for score_10 in y]`. This transformation might be to better suit the reward function or training process of a machine learning model.
*   **Feature Understanding:** While no explicit information is given regarding the meaning of the features, it's essential to analyze their statistical properties (mean, standard deviation, distribution) and their correlations with the target variable to understand their potential influence on the trading strategies. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques should be employed to gain insights into the feature space.

**4. Discuss Sampling:**

*   **Training/Testing Split:** The dataset is explicitly divided into training and testing sets.  The training data is used to train the expert self-assessment modules, the diffusion models for trajectory generation, and potentially the ensemble weighting mechanism. The testing data is used to evaluate the system's performance on unseen data and to assess its generalization ability.
*   **Data Selection:** It is critical to ensure that the training data adequately represents the various market conditions the system is expected to encounter.  If specific market regimes (e.g., high volatility, low liquidity) are underrepresented in the training data, the system's performance in those regimes may be suboptimal.
*   **Temporal Considerations:**  Given the time-series nature of the data, it's important to avoid data leakage from the future into the past.  A strict temporal split should be enforced, where the testing data represents a period *after* the training data.  Techniques like walk-forward optimization or rolling-window validation can be used to simulate real-world trading scenarios and evaluate the system's performance over time.
*   **Stationarity and Data Preprocessing:** If the time series data is non-stationary (i.e., its statistical properties change over time), it may be necessary to apply data preprocessing techniques such as differencing or detrending to make the data more stationary before training the models.

**5. Address Limitations:**

*   **Data Quality:** The performance of the system is highly dependent on the quality and representativeness of the data acquired from the Numin Platform. Any biases or inaccuracies in the data can negatively impact the system's performance. It's important to carefully validate the data and address any data quality issues.
*   **Feature Engineering:**  The success of the trading strategies depends on the quality of the features used to represent market conditions. While the dataset provides a set of features, it may be necessary to engineer additional features that capture more complex market dynamics or that are more relevant to specific trading strategies.
*   **Overfitting:** The risk of overfitting is significant, particularly with complex models and limited data. Regularization techniques (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization), cross-validation, and out-of-sample testing are crucial for mitigating overfitting. The temporal split is essential to prevent overfitting to the testing data.
*   **Data Distribution Shift:** Market conditions can change significantly over time. The distribution of the training data may not be representative of future market conditions. It's important to monitor the system's performance over time and retrain the models periodically with updated data to adapt to changing market dynamics. Consider implementing concept drift detection techniques to identify when retraining is necessary.
*   **Platform Dependency:** The reliance on the Numin Platform API introduces a dependency. Changes to the API or data availability could disrupt the system's operation. Building in redundancy and alternative data sources could mitigate this risk.

This methodology incorporates the dataset context information, addressing data acquisition, format, and preprocessing, and highlighting the importance of data quality, sampling strategies, and mitigation of potential issues like overfitting and data distribution shift.
