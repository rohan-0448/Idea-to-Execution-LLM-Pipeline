The paper "Deep Portfolio Management" introduces a novel, financial-model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for financial portfolio management, leveraging deep machine learning. The core of the framework is the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology, where each evaluator assesses the potential growth of individual assets. Other key components include Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM) to account for transaction costs and Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) for training. The framework is instantiated with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and is evaluated in cryptocurrency markets using a 30-minute trading period. The results demonstrate that all three instances of the framework outperform other portfolio selection strategies, achieving at least 4-fold returns in 50 days despite high commission rates. The study also highlights the decentralization and openness of cryptocurrency markets as ideal testbeds for algorithmic portfolio management experiments.
