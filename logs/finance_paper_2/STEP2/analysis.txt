Okay, I will follow your instructions to analyze the provided text about Deep Portfolio Management.

**1. Critical Reading:**

*   **Novelty:** The paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning framework specifically tailored for portfolio management. The EIIE architecture seems to be the core contribution, addressing limitations of previous approaches.
*   **Clarity:** The paper is well-structured, with clear definitions of the problem, proposed solution, and experimental setup. The mathematical formalism is helpful in understanding the underlying concepts.
*   **Soundness:** The framework appears logically sound, addressing key challenges in portfolio management like transaction costs and market dynamics. The experimental results support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
*   **Limitations:** The authors acknowledge the limitations of the study, specifically the assumptions of zero market impact and slippage. These are important considerations for real-world deployment.
*   **Reproducibility:** The paper provides sufficient details on the architecture, training scheme, and experimental setup, which should aid in reproducibility. However, access to the specific cryptocurrency market data used in the experiments would be necessary for full replication.

**2. Creative Reading:**

*   **EIIE and Human Intuition:** The EIIE structure mirrors how a human trader might analyze individual stocks before making portfolio allocation decisions. Each IIE specializes in assessing a specific asset, contributing to a more nuanced understanding.
*   **PVM as a "Memory" of Past Decisions:**  The PVM acts as a memory for the RL agent, allowing it to learn from past trading actions and their consequences on transaction costs.  This can be seen as analogous to a trader's experience and how they adjust their strategies over time.
*   **OSBL and Adaptability:** The OSBL scheme enables continuous learning and adaptation to changing market conditions.  This is crucial in dynamic markets like cryptocurrencies, where trends can shift rapidly.
*   **Beyond Cryptocurrencies:** While the experiments focus on the cryptocurrency market, the framework's model-free nature suggests potential applicability to other financial markets.
*   **Combining with other Techniques:** The framework could potentially be combined with other financial techniques, such as sentiment analysis or macroeconomic indicators, to further improve performance.

**3. Notes:**

*   **EIIE:** Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators. Key innovation for scalability, data efficiency, and asset collection plasticity.
*   **PVM:** Portfolio-Vector Memory. Addresses transaction costs and enables parallel mini-batch training.
*   **OSBL:** Online Stochastic Batch Learning.  Facilitates continuous learning with a probability-decaying rate favoring recent market events.
*   **Model-Free RL:**  No prior financial models are required. Learns directly from market data.
*   **Cryptocurrency Market:** Used as a testbed due to decentralization, openness, and 24/7 trading.
*   **Performance Metrics:** fAPV (final Accumulated Portfolio Value), Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted return), MDD (Maximum Drawdown).
*   **Assumptions:** Zero market impact and slippage.
*   **Limitations:** Only tested in cryptocurrency market.
*   **Future Directions:** Incorporate market impact, slippage, and test in other markets.

**4. Summary:**

This research paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for financial portfolio management. The framework leverages an Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) to assess individual assets, a Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM) to account for transaction costs, and an Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme for continuous adaptation. The framework is model-free and has been shown to outperform other portfolio selection strategies in the cryptocurrency market. The authors acknowledge limitations related to market impact and slippage, and suggest avenues for future research to improve the framework's real-world applicability.

**5. Methodology:**

The methodology employed in this research can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Problem Definition:** The authors define the financial portfolio management problem as a continuous reallocation of capital into different financial assets to maximize returns while restraining risk. They provide a mathematical formulation of the problem, including transaction costs.
2.  **Framework Development:** They propose a deep reinforcement learning framework consisting of the EIIE topology, PVM, OSBL scheme, and an explicit reward function based on logarithmic returns. They design and implement three instances of the framework using CNN, RNN, and LSTM networks.
3.  **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** They acquire historical price data from the Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange. They preselect the 11 most-volumed non-cash assets and treat missing data points with flat fake price movements. They normalize the price data before feeding it into the neural networks.
4.  **Experimental Design:** They conduct three back-test experiments with different time frames in the cryptocurrency market. They compare the performance of the EIIE-based instances with other portfolio selection strategies and benchmarks.
5.  **Evaluation Metrics:** They use several performance measures to evaluate the strategies, including the final Accumulated Portfolio Value (fAPV), Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown (MDD).
6.  **Parameter Selection:** The hyper-parameters of the framework are chosen based on cross-validation on a separate dataset.
7.  **Comparison and Analysis:** They compare the performance of the different strategies based on the evaluation metrics. They analyze the results and discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed framework.
8. **Proofs**: A proof of the convergence of the method to determine transaction remainder factor is provided.
