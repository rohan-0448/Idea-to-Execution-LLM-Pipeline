**4. Summary**

The paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework for financial portfolio management, designed to be scalable, adaptable, and capable of online learning. The core of the framework lies in the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology, which allows for efficient asset evaluation and weight sharing. The Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM) addresses transaction costs by storing previous portfolio weights, enabling parallel mini-batch training. The Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme allows the agent to continuously learn from incoming market data. The framework is tested with CNN, RNN, and LSTM networks in the cryptocurrency market, achieving superior performance compared to traditional strategies. The main limitations are the reliance on zero slippage and zero market impact assumptions, and testing within just one market.

**5. Methodology**

1.  **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
    *   Obtain historical price data (opening, high, low, closing) from the Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange API.
    *   Preselect the top-11 most-volumed non-cash assets (coins) based on their trading volume over the 30 days preceding the backtest period.
    *   Construct the price tensor Xt of shape (3, n, m), where m = 11 (number of assets), n = 50 (number of past periods), and the features are normalized high, low, and closing prices relative to the latest closing prices.
    *   Handle missing data (NANs) by filling them with flat fake price movements (zero decay rate).
2.  **Framework Implementation:**
    *   Implement the EIIE topology using CNN, RNN, and LSTM networks. The networks independently evaluate assets and interconnect at the softmax layer.
    *   Create the Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM) to store portfolio weights in chronological order.
    *   Implement the Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme for training the policy network. Select mini-batches of size nb = 50 with a geometrically distributed probability Pβ (tb), using a decay rate of β = 5 × 10−5.
    *   Use a deterministic policy gradient method to train the agent, maximizing the average logarithmic returns reward function.  Use Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 3 × 10−5 and L2 regularization with a coefficient of 10−8.
3.  **Training and Backtesting:**
    *   Pre-train the policy network on historical data. The paper uses 2 million steps for pre-training.
    *   Perform backtesting on three different time ranges in the Poloniex market, with a trading period of 30 minutes.
    *   Compare the performance of the EIIE networks with several benchmark strategies (Best Stock, UBAH, UCRP) and traditional portfolio selection algorithms.
4.  **Performance Evaluation:**
    *   Evaluate the performance of each strategy using Accumulated Portfolio Value (APV), Sharpe Ratio (SR), and Maximum Drawdown (MDD).
