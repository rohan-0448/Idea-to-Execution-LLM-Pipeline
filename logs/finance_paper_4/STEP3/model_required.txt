"model_architecture": "The paper successfully employs a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for portfolio management. Given the problem's continuous action space and the authors' findings, an Actor-Critic method with Deterministic Policy Gradients (DPG) is a strong choice. The specific architecture could be built upon the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology, using CNNs, RNNs, or LSTMs as the base learners for the individual evaluators. The Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM) and Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme are also crucial components of the framework."
