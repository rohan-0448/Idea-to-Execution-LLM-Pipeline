Okay, let's refine this methodology further, focusing on clarity, appropriateness, and providing pseudocode for the training and testing phases.

**1. Check Method Details:**

*   The generated methodology includes a comparison step (point 8). This is fine as it will compare with the baselines MCTD or CodeMonkeys algorithms.

**2. Was Idea Adapted?**

*   Yes, the idea of combining AoE with either MCTD or CodeMonkeys is adapted, and the methodology incorporates the specific details of the Numin platform data and target variable transformation. The limitations are also acknowledged.

**3. Is Method Appropriate?**

*   Yes, the method is appropriate for the problem. It addresses the key challenges of algorithmic trading with a dynamic ensemble approach, considering data limitations and the discretized target variable.

**4. Method Steps (Refined):**

Here's a slightly more streamlined version of the method steps, with more emphasis on the overall flow:

1.  **Data Acquisition and Preparation:**
    *   Download training and testing data from the Numin platform API.
    *   Load pre-existing training data from the `./training_data` folder.
    *   Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including analyzing the distribution of features.
    *   Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets (temporal split).
    *   Apply target variable transformation: `y = [int(2 * (score_10 + 1)) for score_10 in y]`.
    *   Scale numerical features (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).
    *   Handle the 'id' column (stock ID) - one-hot encode or use embeddings if needed.

2.  **Expert Strategy Generation:**
    *   **Option A (MCTD):** Implement MCTD to explore the trading environment and define actions.
    *   **Option B (CodeMonkeys):** Implement CodeMonkeys to generate a diverse set of trading strategies.
    *   The trading strategies will act as "experts".

3.  **Autonomy of Experts (AoE) Implementation:**
    *   Define self-assessment metrics for each expert (strategy) based on market conditions, confidence, and risk.
    *   Implement expert selection based on self-assessments and historical performance.
    *   Implement dynamic adjustment of the expert ensemble (add/remove experts based on performance and risk).
    *   Implement resource allocation (capital distribution) based on expert confidence and risk-adjusted performance.
    *   Implement risk management (stop-loss, diversification).

4.  **Integration and Training:**
    *   Integrate either MCTD or CodeMonkeys generated strategies with the AoE framework.
    *   Train the AoE module and the underlying experts using the training data.
    *   Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters and optimize performance.
    *   Apply regularization to prevent overfitting.

5.  **Backtesting and Evaluation:**
    *   Backtest the integrated system on the test dataset.
    *   Simulate realistic trading conditions (transaction costs, slippage).
    *   Evaluate performance metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate, transaction costs, Sortino ratio.

6.  **Comparison and Analysis:**
    *   Compare the hybrid approach to standalone MCTD or CodeMonkeys.
    *   Compare the performance to benchmark strategies (e.g., buy-and-hold).
    *   Perform sensitivity analysis to assess robustness.
    *   Analyze expert selection and decision-making process for interpretability.

**5. Pseudocode:**

Key improvements in the pseudocode:

*   Clear separation of training and testing phases.
*   Functions for key components (data preprocessing, expert generation, AoE initialization, simulation, evaluation).
*   Explicit handling of data preprocessing within both training and testing.
*   Emphasis on the simulation loop in the `simulate_trading` function, which is the core of backtesting.
*   Use of helper functions to create a modular design.
