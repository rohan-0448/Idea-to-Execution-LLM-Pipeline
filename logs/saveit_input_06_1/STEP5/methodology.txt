<content>: "Okay, I'm ready to incorporate the dataset details into the methodology. Here's the updated systematic approach:

**1. Introduce Method:** (No change)

The paper introduces a new algorithmic trading framework combining Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE) with Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD).

**2. Establish Connections:** (Minor changes to reflect data availability)

The dataset used in this research consists of historical market data obtained via API calls to the Numin Platform. The data is split into training and testing sets. Training data, already downloaded and stored in the `./training_data` directory as CSV files (e.g., `df_val_01-Apr-2024.csv`), contains features related to stock IDs (text format) and other market indicators (float values), along with a target variable. The target variable, initially in the range [-1, 1], is transformed to [0, 4] using the formula `y = [int(2 * (score_10 + 1)) for score_10 in y]`.

**3. Discuss Analysis:** (Expanded to include data preprocessing and feature engineering considerations)

Before model training and evaluation, the data undergoes preprocessing. This involves:

*   **Loading Data:** Reading the CSV files from the `./training_data` directory into pandas DataFrames.
*   **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values (if any) using appropriate imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median, or more sophisticated methods).
*   **Feature Scaling:** Scaling numerical features to a standard range (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler) to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process.
*   **Target Transformation:** Applying the provided transformation to convert the target variable from [-1, 1] to [0, 4].
*   **Feature Engineering (Potential):** While the prompt indicates not to assume additional information, exploring potential feature engineering opportunities based on the raw features *could* be beneficial. This might involve creating technical indicators, interaction terms between features, or lagged variables. This should be done cautiously, respecting the constraint of no prior knowledge.

**4. Discuss Sampling:** (Focused on training/validation split, and time-series considerations)

Given the time-series nature of the financial data, a standard random train/test split is inappropriate. Instead, a chronological split is crucial to avoid lookahead bias. The data should be split into training and validation sets based on time. For example, the earlier data could be used for training, and the later data for validation.  Considerations for sampling include:

*   **Validation Set Creation:** Creating a validation set that mirrors the statistical properties of the test data as closely as possible.
*   **Time-Based Splitting:** Ensuring that the validation set represents a future period relative to the training data to simulate real-world trading conditions.
*   **Cross-Validation (Time-Series):** Employing time-series cross-validation techniques (e.g., walk-forward validation) to robustly evaluate the model's performance and avoid overfitting.

**5. Address Limitations:** (Added data-related limitations)

The methodology has several limitations:

*   **Data Availability and Quality:** The performance of the system is highly dependent on the quality and representativeness of the data obtained from the Numin Platform. Potential issues include data errors, biases, and limited historical depth.
*   **Feature Understanding:** The "black box" nature of the features provided by the Numin Platform limits the ability to perform in-depth feature engineering and interpretability.
*   **Market Regime Dependence:** The performance of the system may vary significantly depending on the prevailing market conditions. The training data may not fully capture the range of possible market scenarios.
*   **Computational Cost of MCTD:** The computational complexity of MCTD can be a limiting factor, especially when dealing with large datasets and complex trading strategies.
*   **Expert Conflict Resolution:** The potential for conflicting signals from different experts needs to be addressed.
*   **Defining Market State:** Accurately defining the "market state" for expert self-evaluation is crucial and challenging.

**Updated Methodology Incorporating Dataset Details:**

The paper introduces a new algorithmic trading framework combining Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE) with Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD). The methodology would likely involve:

1.  **Defining the Experts (AoE):** Designing a set of diverse trading strategies ("experts") specialized in different market conditions (e.g., trend-following, mean reversion, volatility-based). Each expert would have a defined self-evaluation function based on market state features (provided in the Numin Platform dataset) and pre-defined criteria for participation.

2.  **Implementing MCTD:** Using diffusion models to generate potential trading trajectories based on the current market state (derived from the Numin Platform data). Structuring these trajectories into a tree, where each node represents a partially denoised plan.

3.  **Integrating AoE and MCTD:** Developing a mechanism for experts to evaluate their suitability for the market conditions present in each trajectory state generated by MCTD. Experts meeting the activation criteria would "participate" in the trade, providing feedback on the potential outcomes of each trajectory.

4.  **Defining Meta-Actions:** Implementing meta-actions within the MCTD framework to control the exploration-exploitation trade-off and dynamically adjust the participation thresholds of the experts based on overall risk levels.

5.  **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocessing the Numin Platform data includes:
    *   Loading the CSV files from the `./training_data` directory into pandas DataFrames.
    *   Handling missing values (if any) using appropriate imputation techniques.
    *   Scaling numerical features to a standard range (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).
    *   Applying the provided transformation to convert the target variable from [-1, 1] to [0, 4].

6.  **Evaluation:** Testing the system using historical market data from the Numin Platform.  A chronological split is crucial to avoid lookahead bias. The data should be split into training and validation sets based on time. Metrics used would likely include Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and transaction frequency. Comparing its performance (profitability, risk-adjusted returns, adaptability) against traditional algorithmic trading strategies and alternative reinforcement learning approaches. The evaluation would need to consider various market regimes and transaction costs.

7.  **Parameter Tuning:** Optimizing the parameters of both the experts' self-evaluation functions and the MCTD algorithm (e.g., diffusion model parameters, tree exploration parameters, meta-action parameters) using techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization.

This updated methodology explicitly addresses the dataset context, including preprocessing steps, time-series considerations for splitting the data, and limitations related to the dataset.
