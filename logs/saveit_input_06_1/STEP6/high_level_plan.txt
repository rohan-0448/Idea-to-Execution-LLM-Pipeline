Okay, I've reviewed the provided text and the existing methodology. Here's the refined methodology based on the systematic approach, focusing on clarity, appropriateness, and pseudocode:

**1. Check Method Details:**

The generated methodology focuses on describing the proposed trading system (AoE + MCTD) and how it would be implemented. It also covers data handling and evaluation. It does not directly compare performance against other models in the initial methodology description, which aligns with the instructions.

**2. Was Idea Adapted?**

Yes, the original idea of combining AoE and MCTD for algorithmic trading has been adapted to incorporate details about the Numin Platform dataset, including data preprocessing steps and considerations for time-series data splitting.

**3. Is Method Appropriate?**

Yes, the methodology is appropriate for the problem. It outlines a reasonable approach to building and evaluating the proposed trading system, considering the constraints of the provided dataset and the need for time-series-aware evaluation.

**4. Method Steps (Detailed):**

Here's a breakdown of the method steps, elaborating on the key components:

1.  **Define the Experts (Autonomy of Experts - AoE):**
    *   **Expert Design:** Create a diverse set of 'expert' trading strategies. Examples include:
        *   Trend-following expert
        *   Mean-reversion expert
        *   Volatility-based expert
    *   **Self-Evaluation Function:** For each expert, define a function that assesses its suitability for the current market conditions. This function should:
        *   Take market state features (from the Numin Platform data) as input.
        *   Calculate a score representing the expert's confidence in its ability to profit.
        *   Compare the score to a pre-defined activation threshold.
    *   **Participation Decision:** Based on the self-evaluation score, each expert autonomously decides whether to participate in the trade.

2.  **Implement Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD):**
    *   **Trajectory Generation:** Use a diffusion model to generate multiple potential trading trajectories, starting from the current market state. Each trajectory represents a sequence of potential future market states and corresponding trading actions.
    *   **Tree Structure:** Organize the trajectories into a tree structure. The root node represents the current market state. Each branch represents a possible sequence of trading actions.
    *   **Node Evaluation:** Evaluate each node (representing a partial trajectory) based on factors like:
        *   Predicted profitability
        *   Risk exposure
        *   Expert consensus
    *   **Tree Exploration:** Explore different branches of the tree using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. This involves:
        *   Selection: Choose the most promising node to explore further.
        *   Expansion: Generate new child nodes by taking different trading actions.
        *   Simulation: Simulate the outcome of the actions.
        *   Backpropagation: Update the node values based on the simulation results.

3.  **Integrate AoE and MCTD:**
    *   **Expert Evaluation per Trajectory State:** For each trajectory state generated by MCTD, each expert evaluates its suitability using its self-evaluation function.
    *   **Expert Participation:** Experts that meet their activation criteria "participate" in the trade.
    *   **Feedback Integration:** Participating experts provide feedback on the potential outcomes of each trajectory, helping MCTD to refine its plans. This feedback could be in the form of:
        *   Reward signals (e.g., predicted profit/loss)
        *   Risk assessments

4.  **Define Meta-Actions:**
    *   **Meta-Action Design:** Implement meta-actions within the MCTD framework to control the exploration-exploitation trade-off. These meta-actions can:
        *   Dynamically adjust the exploration bias of the MCTS algorithm.
        *   Adjust the participation thresholds of the experts based on the overall risk level.
        *   Promote or suppress the use of specific experts based on market conditions.

5.  **Data Preprocessing (Numin Platform Data):**
    *   **Loading Data:** Load the CSV files from the `./training_data` directory into pandas DataFrames.
    *   **Missing Value Handling:** Handle any missing values using appropriate imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median, or more sophisticated methods). Justify the choice of imputation method.
    *   **Feature Scaling:** Scale numerical features to a standard range (e.g., using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).
    *   **Target Transformation:** Apply the provided transformation to convert the target variable from [-1, 1] to [0, 4].
    *   **Time-Series Split:** Split the data into training and validation sets based on time.

6.  **Evaluation:**
    *   **Backtesting:** Test the system using historical market data from the Numin Platform.
    *   **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate performance using metrics such as:
        *   Sharpe ratio
        *   Maximum drawdown
        *   Transaction frequency
        *   Total Profit
    *   **Comparison (Optional):** If possible, compare the system's performance against a benchmark strategy (e.g., a simple moving average crossover strategy). Be mindful of the limitations.
    *   **Market Regime Analysis:** Analyze the system's performance across different market regimes (e.g., bull markets, bear markets, volatile markets).

7.  **Parameter Tuning:**
    *   **Parameter Selection:** Identify the key parameters of the experts' self-evaluation functions and the MCTD algorithm that need to be optimized.
    *   **Optimization Technique:** Use techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization to find the optimal parameter values.
    *   **Validation Set Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of different parameter settings on the validation set to avoid overfitting.

**5. Pseudocode:**

Here's the pseudocode, separated into training and testing phases:

**Training Phase:**

```python
# --- Training Phase ---

# 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
load_data(data_directory="./training_data")  # Loads all CSV files
handle_missing_values(dataframe) #Impute missing values

transform_target(dataframe) #Apply the target transformation

# 2. Time-Series Split
train_data, validation_data = time_based_split(dataframe, split_ratio=0.8)

# 3. Expert Design and Initialization
experts = initialize_experts(expert_types=["trend_following", "mean_reversion", "volatility"]) #Define expert types
for expert in experts:
    expert.define_self_evaluation_function() #Function based on market state features

# 4. MCTD Initialization
mctd = initialize_mctd(diffusion_model_params, tree_search_params)

# 5. Training Loop (Walk-Forward Validation)
for train_window, validation_window in walk_forward_validation(train_data, window_size, stride): #Create validation windows
    # 5.1. Train Diffusion Model (if needed - may be pre-trained)
    mctd.train_diffusion_model(train_window)

    # 5.2. Optimize Experts and MCTD parameters based on validation data
    best_params = optimize_parameters(
        experts,
        mctd,
        validation_window,
        objective_function=sharpe_ratio  # Example objective
    )

    # 5.3. Update Experts and MCTD with best parameters
    for expert in experts:
        expert.set_parameters(best_params["expert"][expert.type]) #Set the parameters based on expert
    mctd.set_parameters(best_params["mctd"]) #Set MCTD parameters

# 6. Save Trained Model and Parameters
save_model(experts, mctd, "trained_model.pkl")
```

**Testing Phase:**

```python
# --- Testing Phase ---

# 1. Load Trained Model and Parameters
experts, mctd = load_model("trained_model.pkl")

# 2. Load Test Data
test_data = load_test_data(test_data_path)
handle_missing_values(test_data) # Impute missing values
scale_features(test_data) #Scale the features

# 3. Simulate Trading
portfolio = initialize_portfolio()
for market_state in test_data:
    # 3.1. Generate Trading Trajectories with MCTD
    trajectories = mctd.generate_trajectories(market_state)

    # 3.2. Expert Evaluation
    expert_opinions = {}
    for expert in experts:
        expert_opinions[expert.type] = expert.evaluate(market_state) #Self evaluation based on market state

    # 3.3. Integrate Expert Opinions into Trajectory Evaluation
    trajectory_scores = mctd.evaluate_trajectories(trajectories, expert_opinions) #Combine expert opinions with trajectories

    # 3.4. Select Best Trajectory (Trading Action)
    best_trajectory = select_best_trajectory(trajectories, trajectory_scores)
    trading_action = best_trajectory.action

    # 3.5. Execute Trade
    reward = portfolio.execute_trade(trading_action, market_state) #exectute trade based on action

    # 3.6. Update Portfolio
    portfolio.update(reward)

# 4. Evaluate Performance
sharpe = calculate_sharpe_ratio(portfolio.returns)
max_drawdown = calculate_max_drawdown(portfolio.returns)
print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {sharpe}, Max Drawdown: {max_drawdown}")
```

**Important Notes on Pseudocode:**

*   This pseudocode is high-level and needs to be fleshed out with actual implementations of the functions (e.g., `load_data`, `scale_features`, `initialize_experts`, `mctd.generate_trajectories`, etc.).
*   The `optimize_parameters` function would involve a loop over different parameter combinations and evaluation on the validation set.
*   The `expert.evaluate` function needs to implement the expert's self-evaluation logic.
*   The `mctd.evaluate_trajectories` function needs to define how expert opinions are integrated into the trajectory scores.
*   Error handling and edge case management are omitted for brevity but are crucial in a real implementation.

This refined methodology provides a more detailed and actionable plan for building and evaluating the proposed algorithmic trading system, while adhering to the constraints of the problem.
