The paper introduces a novel algorithmic trading system that combines Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE) with Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) to improve adaptability, exploration, and risk management. The AoE component uses multiple independent trading strategies ('experts') that autonomously decide whether to participate in a trade based on market conditions. MCTD generates and refines potential trading trajectories, using meta-actions to balance exploration and exploitation and to dynamically adjust expert participation based on risk. This hybrid approach allows for efficient computation, improved adaptability to changing market conditions, enhanced discovery of novel trading strategies, and dynamic risk adjustment.
