Okay, I will generate a methodology to incorporate the idea described in the provided text. The idea focuses on the data acquisition and preprocessing steps for training and testing the algorithmic trading system, specifically using data from the Numin platform and converting the target variable.

**1. Introduce Method (Data Acquisition and Preprocessing)**

This section details the methodology for acquiring and preparing the data required for training and testing the algorithmic trading system combining AoE and MCTD. The primary data source is the Numin platform, accessed via API calls.  The data preprocessing steps are essential to transform the raw data into a suitable format for training the machine learning models within the AoE and MCTD components. This includes data acquisition, storage, loading, and target variable conversion.

**2. Establish Connections (Integration with Existing Framework)**

The data acquisition and preprocessing steps are crucial components of the overall algorithmic trading system:

*   **AoE (Expert Evaluation):** The training data is used to train the self-assessment modules of each expert trading strategy. These modules learn to predict the relevance score of each strategy based on market conditions represented in the data. Features in the dataset will be used by the expert to determine a suitable action.
*   **MCTD (Trajectory Generation):** The training data is also used to train the diffusion model, which generates trading trajectories for each expert. The data provides the historical market context needed for the diffusion model to learn realistic and potentially profitable trading sequences.
*   **Backtesting and Evaluation:** Both training and testing data are essential for rigorously backtesting the entire system. The training data is used to train the models, while the testing data provides an independent dataset for evaluating the system's generalization performance and preventing overfitting.

**3. Discuss Analysis (Data Characteristics and Exploration)**

The Numin platform provides two types of data: training and testing data.

*   **Training Data:** Located in the `./training_data` directory, with filenames following the format `df_val_DD-MMM-YYYY.csv`. The training data includes features representing market conditions (e.g., price, volume, volatility) and a target variable representing the desired trading outcome. The target variable is initially in the range [-1, 1] and needs to be converted to the range [0, 4] using the formula `y = [int(2 * (score_10 + 1)) for score_10 in y]`. The stock ID is present in the text format. Other features are float values.
*   **Testing Data:** Acquired via API calls to the Numin platform. The testing data has a similar format to the training data, except it lacks the target variable. The testing data is used to evaluate the trained system's performance in a simulated real-world trading environment.

Data analysis should include:

*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.) for each feature in the training dataset to understand data distribution and identify potential outliers.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Examine the correlations between features and the target variable to identify potential predictors and multicollinearity issues.
*   **Time Series Analysis:** Analyze the time series characteristics of the data (e.g., trends, seasonality, autocorrelation) to understand market dynamics and inform the design of trading strategies.

**4. Discuss Sampling (Data Partitioning and Augmentation)**

*   **Data Partitioning:** Split the available training data into training and validation sets. The training set is used to train the models (expert self-assessment modules and diffusion models), while the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and monitor overfitting.
*   **Data Augmentation:** Consider data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training data. This could involve generating synthetic data points by adding noise to existing data or using techniques like time series warping or generative adversarial networks (GANs).
*   **Stratified Sampling:** If the target variable is imbalanced (e.g., one trading outcome is much more frequent than others), use stratified sampling to ensure that each class is adequately represented in both the training and validation sets.
*   **Rolling Window:** Employ a rolling window approach for backtesting to simulate a real-time trading environment and evaluate the system's performance over different time periods.

**5. Address Limitations (Data Quality and Availability)**

*   **Data Quality:** The performance of the algorithmic trading system is highly dependent on the quality of the data. Ensure that the data from the Numin platform is accurate, complete, and free from errors.
*   **Data Availability:** The availability of historical data may be limited, particularly for certain assets or market conditions. This could impact the training and evaluation of the system.
*   **Stationarity:** Financial time series data is often non-stationary, meaning that its statistical properties change over time. This can make it difficult to train stable and reliable models. Consider using techniques like differencing or detrending to make the data more stationary.
*   **Look-Ahead Bias:** Avoid look-ahead bias by ensuring that the models are only trained on data that was available at the time the trading decisions were made. This means using historical data to train the models and evaluating their performance on future data.

In summary, this methodology emphasizes the importance of careful data acquisition, preprocessing, analysis, and sampling techniques to ensure the development of a robust and reliable algorithmic trading system combining AoE and MCTD. Addressing the limitations related to data quality and availability is crucial for the success of the project.
