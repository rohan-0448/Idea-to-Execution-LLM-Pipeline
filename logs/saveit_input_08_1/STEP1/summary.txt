The paper proposes a novel algorithmic trading system combining Autonomy-of-Experts (AoE) with Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD). The system treats different trading strategies as "experts" within the AoE framework. Each expert autonomously evaluates its suitability based on real-time market conditions and calculates a relevance score. MCTD then uses the selected experts to generate and refine trading trajectories. The best trajectories from each activated expert are combined into an ensemble strategy, weighted by relevance scores and backtested performance. Benefits include adaptability, robustness, exploration of new opportunities, and improved risk management. Key challenges involve implementation complexity, computational cost, data requirements for training, and the risk of overfitting, necessitating regularization and out-of-sample testing.
